## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in our project, we take your report seriously and appreciate your effort to responsibly disclose it.

Please submit all vulnerability reports via our official security page:
👉 https://web3.okx.com/security

This ensures your report is routed to the appropriate team for prompt review and response. Please do not open a public issue. We will triage and respond as quickly as possible.

Thank you for helping us keep the ecosystem safe！
